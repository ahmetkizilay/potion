# Potion

A personal note-taking/journaling app, built with Angular and Firebase.

__EXPERIMENTAL__: This repository is at a very early stage. Everything will change, don't depend on it.

## Develop + Demo

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

On another terminal tab, run `firebase emulators:start` to start the Firebase backends locally.

To demo it on firebase: https://potion.cryn.dev/

## Firebase configs

The API key in [environment.ts](src/environments/environment.ts) is autogenerated by Firebase. It is a browser key, so it is "OK" for it to be checked in. However, it should be restricted to use used only in certain origins for extra security.

## Firebase Emulator

Start the emulator: `firebase emulators:start`

Export data: `firebase emulators:export "./emulator-data/"`

Start emulator with data: `firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data/`
